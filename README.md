# 2D-Physics-Engine 🚀

A simple 2D physics simulation implemented in JavaScript.

This project is a simple physics simulation designed for 2D environments. It allows you to add 'marbles' onto a canvas and simulates gravity and friction on them. Note that this project is still a work in progress.

## Live Demo 🌐
You can test the project live at [this link](https://atfastrslushymaker.github.io/2D-Physics-Simulation/).

## Features ✨
- Add Balls to the canvas
- Simulate gravity and friction
- Interactive and fun!
- Throw Balls at each other
- Click to add Balls
